GVM: GHC Version Manager
========================

GVM is a version manager program for GHC.

Usage:
------

'gvm'

    gvm is a command line tool for querying and switching
	 between available GHC versions.

GVM=<version>

    putting 'GHC=<version>' at the start of a command that relies
	 on GHC such as 'cabal install ...' will cause the ghc version
	 specified to be used.

	 e.g $ GVM=7.2.2 cabal install dclabel
	     $ GVM=7.4.1 ./validate

GVM_OPTS=<ghc options>
    
	 putting 'GVM_OPTS=<ghc options>' at the start of a command that
	 relies on GHC will pass options to GHC when invoked. This allows
	 easy overriding of configured GHC options.

	 e.g $ GVM_OPTS=-fllvm make

TODO
----

 * ways to add new GHC's to GVM (and remove them).

 * ghc development assistant
   * way to manager development builds? (better method than 'dghc' aliases)
   * cabal install support (development ghc's) OR maybe more cabal-dev support?
   * validate support (with different bootstrap compiler + options)
	* testsuite support
	* nofib support

 * Record in .hi GHC version to stop error of different GHC versions
   compiling parts of same program

 * Does GHC sepperate between not just versions but also 32/64 bit?
