GVM: GHC Version Manager
========================

GVM is a version manager program for GHC.

Usage:
------

'gvm'

    gvm is a command line tool for querying and switching
	 between available GHC versions.

GHC=<version>

    putting 'GHC=<version>' at the start of a command that relies
	 on GHC such as 'cabal install ...' will cause the ghc version
	 specified to be used.

	 e.g $ GHC=7.2.2 cabal install dclabel
	     $ GHC=7.4.1 ./validate

TODO
----

 * Add HC_OPTS variable to allow putting flags onto GHC?
   e.g $ GHC=7.2.2 HC_OPTS=-fllvm ./validate

 * ways to add new GHC's to GVM (and remove them).

 * ghc development assistant
   * way to manager development builds? (better method than 'dghc' aliases)
   * cabal install support (development ghc's) OR maybe more cabal-dev support?
   * validate support (with different bootstrap compiler + options)
	* testsuite support
	* nofib support
